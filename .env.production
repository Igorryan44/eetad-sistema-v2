# Production Environment Configuration
# This file should be used for production deployments

# API Base URL for production - update this when you have a production backend
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://sistema-eetad-v2.vercel.app

# Note: In production, you'll need to:
# 1. Deploy the local-server to a cloud service (Heroku, Railway, etc.)
# 2. Update VITE_API_BASE_URL to point to your production backend URL
# 3. Configure CORS in the backend for your production domain

# Production considerations:
# - The local-server currently runs on localhost:3003
# - For full production deployment, consider hosting the backend on:
#   * Heroku (free tier available)
#   * Railway
#   * DigitalOcean App Platform
#   * AWS/Azure/GCP
